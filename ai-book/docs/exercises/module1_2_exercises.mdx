# Module 1 & 2 Practice Exercises

These exercises are designed to test your understanding of ROS 2 fundamentals and robot simulation using Gazebo.

## Exercise 1: ROS 2 Publisher-Subscriber

**Challenge**: Create a ROS 2 Python node that publishes a custom message type (e.g., `geometry_msgs/Twist`) and another node that subscribes to it, printing the received data to the console.

**Solution**: (To be provided later)

## Exercise 2: ROS 2 Service

**Challenge**: Implement a ROS 2 Python service that takes two integers as input and returns their sum. Create a client node that calls this service with arbitrary numbers.

**Solution**: (To be provided later)

## Exercise 3: Robot URDF Modification

**Challenge**: Take the humanoid URDF model and add a simple gripper to one of its arms. Visualize the modified robot in RViz.

**Solution**: (To be provided later)

## Exercise 4: Gazebo World Creation

**Challenge**: Create a simple Gazebo world with a few primitive shapes (box, sphere, cylinder) and light sources. Launch your world in Gazebo.

**Solution**: (To be provided later)

## Exercise 5: Sensor Integration

**Challenge**: Modify the humanoid URDF to include both the LiDAR and depth camera sensors. Verify that the sensor data is being published in Gazebo.
