# Building a Robot in URDF

The Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) is an XML format for describing all elements of a robot. You can use URDF to describe the kinematic and dynamic properties of your robot, its visual appearance, and collision properties.

## Kinematic Chains

A robot's structure is defined by a series of **links** and **joints**.
*   **Links**: Represent the rigid bodies of the robot (e.g., a limb, a wheel).
*   **Joints**: Connect links and define their relative motion (e.g., a revolute joint for rotation).

## Visual and Collision Properties

You can define the visual appearance of your robot using meshes (e.g., `.stl`, `.dae`) and basic shapes (e.g., cylinders, boxes). Collision properties are also defined to enable physics simulation and collision detection.

## Building a Humanoid URDF

In this lesson, we will walk through the process of creating a URDF for a simple 20-DOF humanoid robot.
