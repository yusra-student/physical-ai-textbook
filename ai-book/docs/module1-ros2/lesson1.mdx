# Introduction to ROS 2

Welcome to the exciting world of robotics! In this first lesson, we will take our first steps into the Robot Operating System (ROS), specifically ROS 2. ROS is the backbone of modern robotics development, providing a flexible framework for writing robot software.

## What is ROS?

ROS is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. It provides services you would expect from an operating system, including hardware abstraction, low-level device control, implementation of commonly-used functionality, message-passing between processes, and package management.

## Why ROS 2?

ROS 2 is a complete redesign of the original ROS framework to meet the needs of modern robotics. It is built on top of the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard, which provides a real-time, publish-subscribe messaging system. This allows for more robust and scalable robotics applications, suitable for both research and production environments.

## Core Concepts

We will dive deep into these concepts in the upcoming lessons, but here is a quick overview:

*   **Nodes**: A process that performs computation. A ROS 2 system is comprised of many nodes.
*   **Topics**: Nodes can publish messages to a topic as well as subscribe to a topic to receive messages.
*   **Services**: A request/response communication pattern. One node offers a service, and another node can make a request.
*   **Actions**: For long-running tasks, actions provide a way to send a request and receive feedback and a final result.
