# 03 - Quizzes and Summary

This section provides practice materials to reinforce your understanding of the concepts and implementations covered in Module 5.

## Module Summary

In Module 5, "Advanced Intelligent Systems," we delved into the comprehensive integration of three pivotal components:

-   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: We built a knowledge-aware "brain" for our humanoid system, enabling it to query and understand vast amounts of documentation. This involved setting up a Qdrant vector database, implementing document extraction, chunking, embedding generation, and crafting LLM-powered response generation with citations.
-   **Authentication and Authorization (Auth)**: We established a robust security layer with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), user authentication models, API key management, and basic security hardening measures. This ensures that interactions with the intelligent system are secure and controlled.
-   **Intelligent Task Engine**: We designed and implemented a flexible task orchestration framework capable of defining, scheduling, composing, and executing complex, multi-step tasks. Key aspects included state management, conditional logic, and mechanisms for resilience (retries, fallbacks) and monitoring (telemetry).

By integrating these components, we've laid the groundwork for a humanoid robot that can not only understand its world through rich documentation but also act upon that understanding in a secure and intelligent manner. The "Decision-Action Loop" powered by RAG, Auth, and the Task Engine represents a significant step towards truly autonomous and context-aware robotic systems.

## Quizzes

Test your knowledge with these quizzes.

### Quiz 5.1: RAG System Fundamentals

1.  What is the primary purpose of a vector database like Qdrant in a RAG system?
    *   A) To store raw text documents
    *   B) To perform keyword searches
    *   C) To store numerical representations (embeddings) of text for semantic search
    *   D) To generate LLM responses

2.  Which component is responsible for breaking down large documents into smaller, manageable pieces?
    *   A) Embedder
    *   B) Chunker
    *   C) Generator
    *   D) Searcher

3.  What does the `Embedder` component primarily do?
    *   A) Extracts text from documents
    *   B) Converts text into numerical vectors
    *   C) Generates human-like responses
    *   D) Filters search results

### Quiz 5.2: Authentication and Task Security

1.  In our RBAC system, what does a `Permission` represent?
    *   A) A user's role
    *   B) An action that can be performed
    *   C) A specific user
    *   D) A group of users

2.  Why is API key hashing important for security?
    *   A) To make API keys shorter
    *   B) To allow keys to be easily reversed
    *   C) To prevent storing plain-text keys, protecting them from exposure
    *   D) To increase the speed of key validation

3.  What is the main benefit of implementing rate limiting in an API?
    *   A) To speed up API responses
    *   B) To prevent brute-force attacks and resource exhaustion
    *   C) To encrypt API traffic
    *   D) To bypass authentication

### Quiz 5.3: Task Engine Orchestration

1.  Which Redis-based library is used for asynchronous task queuing and execution?
    *   A) Celery
    *   B) RQ (Redis Queue)
    *   C) Apache Kafka
    *   D) RabbitMQ

2.  What is the purpose of `on_success` and `on_failure` attributes in a task step definition?
    *   A) To log success/failure messages
    *   B) To trigger external webhooks
    *   C) To define the next step in the workflow based on the current step's outcome
    *   D) To calculate retry attempts

3.  What does the `TelemetryRecorder` primarily capture?
    *   A) User login attempts
    *   B) Task execution events and metrics
    *   C) Document ingestion progress
    *   D) LLM response quality
